ldesc: "The goal of the lensfun library is to provide a open source 
database of photographic lenses and their characteristics. The lensfun 
library not only provides a way to read the database and search for 
specific things in it, but also provides a set of algorithms for 
correcting images based on detailed knowledge of lens properties and 
calibration data."
